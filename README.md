------------------------------------
April 20th 2023, I'm moving to VEX next year so I won't be maintaining this but I'm working on a interpreter for my own language Desmotic for VEX so this toolkit will be ported to Desmotic and some C++. If anyone wants to help maintain this for the SPIKE PRIME platform feel free. The release branch should include a garbage collector and pointers toolkit
